### LiriBot


LIRI-Bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI-Bot is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 

* LIRI-Bot will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies via requests sent to the corresponding API's.
